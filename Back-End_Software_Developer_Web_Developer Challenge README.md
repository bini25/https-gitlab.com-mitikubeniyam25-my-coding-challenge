# Selected-Homework-challenges 
1. Water Area (5 points):

You are given an array of non-negative integers where each non-zero integer represents the height of a pillar of width 1. Imagine water being poured over all the pillars; write a function that returns the surface area of the water trapped between the pillars viewed from the front. Note that spilled water should be ignored.
Sample Input
heights = [0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3]
Sample Output
48

2. Four-Number Sum (5 points):

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. The function should find all quadruplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and return a two-dimensional array of all these quadruplets in no particular order.
If no four numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.
Sample Input
array = [7, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2]
targetSum = 16
Sample Output
[[7, 6, 4, -1], [7, 6, 1, 2]] // the quadruplets could be ordered differently
# Technologies 
Programing lanague used                Java
source-code editor                Visual Studio Code & online java compiler

# Instructions on how to execute
Note:For both problems the solution is provided using Java programing languge.Any Java compiler should compile and run the provided codes.You can use any  Java editor/JRE/javaIDEs  of your choice.
Just copy both Java classes provided (waterarea.java and FinfFourElements.java), paste to your editor and you should be able to excute it with no problem. 
Here is a link to a simple online java compiler and procedures to run my code
    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php
  - Click on  the link
        on the left side you should see a simple hello world program and on the right side you should where the output will be displayed
  - Copy the java solution code provided for one of the problems (the entire class).
  - Paste it to the left side on the top of the hello world program.
  - On the top left menubar side you should see an option that says Execute.
  - click excute and the output should display on the right side under result.
