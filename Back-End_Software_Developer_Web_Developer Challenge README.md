1. Water Area (5 points):

You are given an array of non-negative integers where each non-zero integer represents the height of a pillar of width 1. Imagine water being poured over all the pillars; write a function that returns the surface area of the water trapped between the pillars viewed from the front. Note that spilled water should be ignored.
 <br />
Sample Input
 <br />
heights = [0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3]
 <br />
Sample Output  <br />
48 <br />


2. Four-Number Sum (5 points):

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. The function should find all quadruplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and return a two-dimensional array of all these quadruplets in no particular order.
If no four numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array. <br />
Sample Input  <br />
array = [7, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2]  <br />
targetSum = 16   <br />
Sample Output   <br />
[[7, 6, 4, -1], [7, 6, 1, 2]] // the quadruplets could be ordered differently <br />
# Technologies

# Instructions on how to execute
Note:for both problems the solution is provided using Java programing languge.Any Java compiler should compile and run the provided codes.You can use any  Java editor/JRE/javaIDEs  of your choice.
Just copy/download both Java classes provided (waterarea.java and FindFourElements.java), paste to your editor and you should be able to excute it with no problem. 

 # Here is a link to a simple online Java compiler and procedures to run my code   <br />
     https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php
  - Click on  the link
       -  on the left side you should see a simple hello world program and on the right side you should see where the output will be displayed
  - Copy the java solution code provided for one of the problems (the entire class).
  - Paste it to the left side on the top of the hello world program.
  - On the menubar near the top left corner  you should see an option that says Execute.
  - click excute button to run the code and the output should be displayed on the right side under result.
